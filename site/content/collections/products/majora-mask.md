Majora's Mask (pronounced /məˈdʒɔ:ɹə/ mə-JAW-rə) is the primary antagonist in the 
game of the same name, once used by an Ancient Tribe as a form of hexing and torture.
The mask is primarily seen being worn by the game's supposed antagonist, Skull Kid, 
who uses its dark magic to wreak havoc across Termina.
