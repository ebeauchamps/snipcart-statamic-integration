The ocarina /ɒkəˈriːnə/ or /oʊkəˈriːnə/ is an ancient wind musical instrument—a 
type of vessel flute. Variations exist, but a typical ocarina is an enclosed space 
with four to twelve finger holes and a mouthpiece that projects from the body. 
It is traditionally made from clay or ceramic, but other materials are also used—such 
as plastic, wood, glass, metal, or bone. An example of an ocarina made of an animal 
horn is the medieval German gemshorn.
